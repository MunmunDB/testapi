# Simple test api

#  The idea is to make comments on how the structure of the code could be improved
#  Concentrate on the controller and how to expand the solution to cope with the needs of your development

#  We need to make this a production ready microservice, so what structural/functional changes would we do to make this happen
#  Also, in the production microservice, the data will come from an external api instead of the local files.
